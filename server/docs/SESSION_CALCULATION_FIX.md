# Session Calculation Fix

## Issue Description

There was a discrepancy between the `session_system_amt` values calculated when creating sessions and the values returned by the invoice API. This was caused by inconsistent calculation formulas between different parts of the codebase.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `session.js` file where the `session_system_amt` was calculated using an incorrect formula:

### Incorrect Formula (in `server/models/session.js`):
```javascript
const session_system_amt = (total_invoice + session_taxes) * system_pcnt;
```

### Correct Formula (in `server/models/thrpyReq.js`):
```javascript
const systemAmount = (totalInvoice + taxAmount) * (refFees.system_pcnt / 100);
```

## The Problem

The `system_pcnt` value from the database is stored as a percentage (e.g., 40 for 40%), but the session.js code was treating it as a decimal (0.40). This caused the system amount to be calculated incorrectly by a factor of 100.

### Example:
- **Service Total Invoice**: $100
- **Tax Percentage**: 5%
- **System Percentage**: 40%

**Incorrect Calculation:**
- Taxes: $100 × 5% = $5
- System Amount: ($100 + $5) × 40 = $4,200 ❌

**Correct Calculation:**
- Taxes: $100 × 5% = $5
- System Amount: ($100 + $5) × 40% = $42 ✅

## Fix Applied

Updated the calculation in `server/models/session.js`:

```javascript
// Before (Incorrect)
const session_system_amt = (total_invoice + session_taxes) * system_pcnt;

// After (Correct)
const session_system_amt = (total_invoice + session_taxes) * (system_pcnt / 100);
```

## Files Modified

1. **`server/models/session.js`** - Fixed the calculation formula
2. **`server/scripts/verify_session_calculations.js`** - Added verification script
3. **`server/scripts/fix_session_calculations.js`** - Added fix script for existing data
4. **`server/tests/api/test_session_calculations.js`** - Added tests

## Verification

To verify the fix:

1. **Run the verification script:**
   ```bash
   node server/scripts/verify_session_calculations.js
   ```

2. **Run the fix script (if needed):**
   ```bash
   node server/scripts/fix_session_calculations.js
   ```

3. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --grep "Session Calculations"
   ```

## Impact

- ✅ **New sessions** will be calculated correctly
- ✅ **Invoice API** will return consistent values
- ✅ **Existing sessions** can be fixed using the provided script
- ✅ **All calculation methods** now use the same formula

## Testing

The fix has been tested with various scenarios:
- Different invoice amounts
- Different tax percentages
- Different system percentages
- Mathematical consistency (total = taxes + system + counselor)

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Use the centralized `calculateSessionAmounts` helper function
2. Always treat percentage values from the database as percentages (divide by 100)
3. Add unit tests for calculation logic
4. Use consistent calculation methods across the codebase
